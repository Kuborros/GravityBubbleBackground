# Custom Gravity Bubble Background

Small mod which changes the background used in Gravity Bubble to closer resemble the structure shown on the world map. That's all it does :3

The lights of the buildings slowly cycle from lit up to lit down, using a dedicated shader adapted from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/heyjoeway/c2d89ef437d119fd88e328fd92948645) by [@heyjoeway](https://gist.github.com/heyjoeway) with few changes to account for DirectX9 support.
If said shader is bit too taxing for your hardware, it can be disabled in plugin config file.
